# S.T.A.R GUIDE

## SPACE
Describe the obstacles you or your team must overcome to complete your project. "I" should not be used in the space area. Instead, address the Space from a factual, omnipresent perspective that emphasizes the larger picture. Avoid using "we" either. Simply relinquish control and talk about the task or difficulty as if it were alive and had a mind of its own.Â Sharing the who, what, where, and when in this situation is useful.

## TRACK
Follows the S.M.A.R.T. Goal approach to give a specific and measurable visualization of the trajectory that the Project STAR is on. The track is easily visualized as a path through time and space that outlines the past, present, and future of the project.

## ASSIST
Explain what you are going to do to assist the STAR in staying on course and achieving the desired path. Be specific and explain how your time will be spent to overcome the challenge or shift the direction of the project. Even if it is a team effort, lead with "I" instead of "we" to detail your individual approach.

## REACH
Include a confident and predictable final result as an outcome of your efforts to summarize the effects of your actions. Additionally, you may discuss what you've learned, offer perspectives you might use to overcome problems in the future, and describe the measurements (facts, figures, and numbers) used to measure the project's reach.
